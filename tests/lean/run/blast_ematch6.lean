-- This is the kind of theorem that can be easily proved using superposition,
-- but cannot to be proved using E-matching.
-- To prove it using E-matching, we must provide the following auxiliary assertion.
-- E-matching can prove it automatically, and then it is trivial to prove the conclusion
-- using it.
-- Remark: this theorem can also be proved using model-based quantifier instantiation (MBQI) available in Z3.
-- So, we may be able to prove it using qcf.
